# HistoricalWIODHeatmaps
Quickly transform changes in major country trade data from the historic WIOD tables into heatmaps, to support future GVA analyses.

The input .csv file used to generate the heatmaps represents the annualised percentage change between 2014 and 2000. This gives an indication of which sectors grew / shrank over that period.
