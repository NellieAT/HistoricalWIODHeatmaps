# HistoricalWIODHeatmaps
Quickly transform changes in major country trade data from the historic WIOD tables into heatmaps, to support future GVA analyses
Original source data: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/valuechain/wiod/wiod-2016-release?lang=en

The input .csv file used to generate the heatmaps represents the annualised percentage change between 2014 and 2000. This gives an indication of which sectors grew / shrank over that period.
